## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **structuring content with semantic HTML** and applying **modern CSS layout techniques** like Flexbox for alignment.  

One small win was understanding why my footer attribution was misaligned â€” it was treated as a flex child of the `<body>`. The fix was to use `flex-direction: column` so it naturally stacked beneath the card.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- I want to focus more on:

- Responsive design patterns for different screen sizes

- CSS Grid for more complex layouts

- Improving accessibility with ARIA roles and better keyboard focus states

### Useful Resources

- MDN Web Docs - Flexbox

- Frontend Mentor Community
